After All Tomorrow Is Another Day
After all this time? Always
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
Bond James Bond
Bye Felicia!
Feed Me! Feed Me!
Frankly My Dear I Don't Give A Damn
Go Ahead Make My Day
Here's Looking At You Kid
How Do You Like Them Apples?
How am I funny?
I Am Serious And Don't Call Me Shirley
I didn’t want to get blood on your floor
I Drink Your Milkshake
I Feel The Need For Speed
I'll Be Back
I'll Get You My Pretty And Your Little Dog Too!
I'M Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse
I'M The King Of The World
If You Build It He Will Come
It's Showtime!
Keep The Change Ya Filthy Animal!
Let it go, let it go!
Lion And Tigers And Bears Oh My!
Luca Brasi Sleeps With The Fishes
May the force be with you
Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut
Nobody Puts Baby In A Corner
Now go home and get your fuckin’ shinebox
Release The Kraken
Run Forest, run!
There's No Place Like Home
Use The Force Luke
We were good fellas. Wiseguys 
Welcome To The Party Pal!
You Had Me At Hello
You Shall Not Pass!
You Talkin' To Me?
You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat
You're Killin' Me Smalls
